## Matrix Rain Animation

This small project renders a Matrix style "digital rain" animation on an HTML canvas.

To see it in action, simply open `index.html` in your browser. The rain is slightly faster now and uses both Latin and Katakana symbols for a more authentic vibe. Each added frame can be moved, resized, minimized with the green underscore, and removed with the red **X** in its corner. Frame positions, sizes and minimized state are saved locally so they persist when you reload the page.
